# Student Guide: AI Course Development Environment

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** installed on your computer
  - Windows/Mac: Download from [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
  - Linux: Follow [Docker Engine installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### 2. Setup (One-time)
1. Download the Docker files from your instructor:
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `docker-compose.yml`
   - `setup.sh`
   - `STUDENT_GUIDE.md` (this file)

2. Open terminal/command prompt in the folder with these files

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   .\setup.sh
   
   # On Mac/Linux:
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. Wait for the setup to complete (downloads course repository and builds environment)

### 3. Start Working
```bash
# Start the development environment
docker-compose up ai-course-dev

# Or start Jupyter Notebook
docker-compose up jupyter
```

## What's Included

The Docker environment automatically includes:
- **Course Repository**: https://github.com/ftakelait/csp-scheduling-project/
- **CSP Scheduling Project**: Complete assignment with GUI, tests, and grader
- **Python 3.11** with all necessary packages
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter, pytest, git, vim, nano
- **Persistent Storage**: Your work is saved in your home directory

## Your Work Directories

All your work is automatically saved in your home directory:
- `~/ai-course-work/` - Your assignment work
- `~/ai-course-projects/` - Your own projects
- `~/ai-course-data/` - Data files
- `~/ai-course-output/` - Generated files
- `~/ai-course-submissions/` - Assignment submissions
- `~/ai-course-grading/` - Grading results

## Working with Assignments

### CSP Scheduling Project
```bash
# Run the main assignment
docker-compose run --rm ai-course-dev run_assignment csp-scheduling-project

# Or start the development environment and work interactively
docker-compose up ai-course-dev
```

### Inside the Container
Once inside the container, you can:
```bash
# Navigate to the assignment
cd /workspace/assignments/csp-scheduling-project/

# Run the main program
python src/csp_scheduling_project.py

# Run tests
python test_project.py

# Start the GUI
python gui/scheduler_gui.py

# Run the grader on your work
python grader.py /workspace/student_work/my_solution.py
```

### Creating Your Own Projects
```bash
# Create a new project
docker-compose run --rm ai-course-dev create_project my_awesome_project

# Work on your project
cd ~/ai-course-projects/my_awesome_project/
```

## Jupyter Notebook

For interactive development:
```bash
# Start Jupyter
docker-compose up jupyter

# Open in browser: http://localhost:8889
```

## Useful Commands

### Container Management
```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up ai-course-dev

# Start Jupyter
docker-compose up jupyter

# Stop all containers
docker-compose down

# View running containers
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs
```

### Assignment Commands
```bash
# List all assignments
docker-compose run --rm ai-course-dev list_assignments

# Run specific assignment
docker-compose run --rm ai-course-dev run_assignment csp-scheduling-project

# Grade your submission
docker-compose run --rm ai-course-dev grade_assignment /workspace/student_work/my_file.py
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Create new project
docker-compose run --rm ai-course-dev create_project project_name

# Start interactive shell
docker-compose run --rm ai-course-dev /bin/bash
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues
```bash
# If containers won't start
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f
docker-compose up ai-course-dev

# If image is corrupted
docker-compose down
docker rmi ai-course-dev_ai-course-dev
docker-compose build
```

### Permission Issues (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Fix file permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/ai-course-*
```

### Windows Issues
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Use PowerShell or WSL for better compatibility
- If paths have spaces, use quotes: `"C:\Users\Your Name\ai-course-work"`

## Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: `docker-compose logs`
2. **Restart containers**: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up ai-course-dev`
3. **Rebuild if needed**: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
4. **Ask your instructor** with the error message

## Course Repository

The environment automatically includes the course repository:
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/ftakelait/csp-scheduling-project/
- **Location in container**: `/workspace/assignments/csp-scheduling-project/`

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the CSP assignment** in `/workspace/assignments/csp-scheduling-project/`
2. **Create your own projects** using `create_project`
3. **Use Jupyter** for interactive development
4. **Submit your work** to the `~/ai-course-submissions/` directory

Happy coding! ðŸš€
